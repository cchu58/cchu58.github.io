				<h1>Adobe Indesign</h1>
					
                <p>Finally here is my portfolio I made for my print final. I felt that indesign was a lot more intuitive for me. I love learning about master pages and paragraph styles. They made making this final a lot easier.</p>
                
                <p>My print final is a compilation of postcards that feature my finals on the front and a short description on the back side. I first made a master page as a template for all the postcards and this included paragraph styles for the "mailing address labels" and the descriptions.</p>
                
                <p>I also included a lookbook I worked on for one of the module challenges. This lookbook features Cecilie Bahnsen's most recent collection(which is also the subject of my pixel final). This print file includes a simple master page that included the type, frame for photo, and a footer.</p>
                
                <p>My website is visually inspired by my print final(which was originally inspired by my pixel final). I had originally lifted my print final color palette from my floral motif in my vector final. So I continued a similar palette on my website. This made everything more cohesive with a similar color palette/theme/subject across several projects.</p>

				<h1>Adobe Illustrator</h1>
					
                <p>I made a pretend personal logo for if I were a florist for my vector final. I've always liked sketching flowers, so the floral motif is one of my sketches from a few years back.</p>
                
                <p>I imported my floral motif and turned it into a template to trace over. Then I used live paint to fill in the arrangement with gradient colors. Ceciliaâ€™s floral is typed on a circular path and a stained glass effect is used for the background and the circles surrounding the flowers. </p>
                
                <p>I found Illustrator to be the most confusing and frustrating program we used during this class and I'm still not entirely sure I understand it as well as I should haha. I am taking an Illustrator course next semester so I hope to improve upon my skills.</p>

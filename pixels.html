                <p>I was inspired to make a collage of one of my favorite designers for my pixel final. Cecilie Bahnsen is a Danish designer who creates beautiful, flowy, and dreamlike designs.</p>
                
                <p>The background layer is a combination of her photo and a close up of one of her designs that has fantastic textural elements. I placed two presser feet above her and three designs from her SS 2020 collection to the right. I added a dashed line to the border to mimic stitching. The presser feet and three dresses were cutout with the lasso tool and I tried to be as meticulous as I could so that it looked seamless. </p>
